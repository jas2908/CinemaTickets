Kort beskrivelse av applikasjon (5-10 setninger):
This is an application that registers ticket order for cinema. I have tried to keep the GUI as close as possible to the one provided in the assignment. After choosing a fim, the user enters the total number of tickets to be purchased. This value is between 1 and 9. The application also has in place an error handling mechanism. The error messages go away once the user enters some value in the input field.The details saved are displayed as a table under the heading 'Alle Billetter'.Finally, the 'Slett alle billettene' button empties the array and deletes all the values being displayed. The application has been updated with the use of jquery and bootstrap. While it retains its original functionality,it has been styled and can be saved on a server.
The updated version of the application replaces the array with a table in relationsdatabase.It works on H2 console. The surnames are sorted alphabetically on the server sid.It uses schema.sql instead of hibernate.
